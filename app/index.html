        <h1>CustomServer</h1>
        <h3>A simple and easily customized web server for Node.js<h3>

        <h2>MANIFESTO</h2>
        <p>The goal here is to include the minimum set of built-in modules to handle everything a regular web server needs to be able to handle. A web server should:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Allow access to standard file types (HTML, images, etc.)</li>
            <li>Elegantly handle bad URLs</li>
            <li>Accept GET and POST requests (For interactive apps)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The end result should be a server that is usable for static pages immediately, and is quick and easy to customize for interactive pages with a minimum of fuss.</p>

        <div class="notice">This is NOT a server that needs an extensive set of add-on modules to be fully functional. It is ideal for the frontend developer who wants to just start writing HTML and JavaScript immediately and have it work.</div>

        <p>To develop interactive apps that send, receive, and store data in a database or file on the node.js host, you will of course need whatever modules are required for that project.</p>

        <h2>USAGE</h2>

        <h3>Startup</h3>
        <p>To start CustomServer, use "node customserver.js". It assumes there is a subdirectory called /app and a file there called index.html. These are easily customized in the script itself. (See below).</p>

        <p>CustomServer starts the http process on 127.0.0.1:1337 by default. Anything you put in /app, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, will be served up appropriately.</p>

        <h3>Default options and customization</h3>
        <p>The built-in customization options for CustomServer are detailed below:</p>
        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Option</th>
                    <th>Default value</th>
                    <th>Explanation</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>

                    <td><p>This is an array of addresses. CustomServer will start a listener on each address specified.</p>

But most web apps need to be able to respond to things like POST requests and attempts to retrieve data in ways that involve instructing the server to perform certain tasks, rather than just displaying a file.</p>
                        <p>if ENABLE_API is set to 1, CustomServer will pass all POSTs, and any GETs that request something other than a file or directory that is present on the server, to a function called <em>processAPI()</em>. It is this function's job to determine what needs to be done with the POST or GET it receives.</p>
                        <p>By default, <em>processAPI()</em> only contains placeholders. It is up to the web developer to populate the function with appropriate mechanisms for responding to the POST and GET requests.</p>
